# Pathfinder_Feat_Explorer
Some simple python scripts for interacting with the overwhelming database of character 
feats in the Pathfinder RPG

## FeatExplorer.py
The core script, a console app that can sort through and display feats 
read from a file passed as an argument to the script.

## ParseFeatCsv.py
Reads from the "FeatsBase.csv" file, which must be in the same directory as the script.
Will output a re-formatted and condensed csv as feats.csv in the format expected by FeatExplorer.py
